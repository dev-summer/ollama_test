Include brief explanation for the decision.

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1. Be specific with line numbers and file names
2. Provide actual code examples in suggestions
3. Explain the reasoning behind each suggestion
4. Focus on iOS and SwiftUI-specific best practices
5. Consider both current functionality and future maintenance
6. Keep performance and scalability in mind
7. Check for SwiftUI-specific anti-patterns
